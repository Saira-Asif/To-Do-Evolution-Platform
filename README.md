# Multi-Phase Todo Application - Console to Cloud

This project demonstrates the evolution of a simple todo application from a console application to a cloud-native distributed system. The implementation follows a phased approach with progressive complexity.

## Phases

1. **Phase I**: Console Application - Python CLI with Rich interface
2. **Phase II**: Web Application - Next.js frontend with FastAPI backend
3. **Phase III**: AI Chatbot - Natural language todo creation
4. **Phase IV**: Kubernetes Deployment - Containerized orchestration
5. **Phase V**: Cloud Production - Production-scale distributed system

## Quick Start

See [quickstart.md](specs/001-todo-app-arch-evolution/quickstart.md) for detailed setup instructions for each phase.

## Architecture
